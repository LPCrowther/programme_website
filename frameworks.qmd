This project is developing virtual labs (cloud-based environments supporting collaborative science) to enable trustworthy and accountable decision-making to promote biodiversity in solar parks and agriculture. 

The virtual labs will allow decision-makers and land managers to understand the interactions and feedbacks between food and energy production and environmental systems. 

Users will be able to explore how their management actions can enhance biodiversity, and the potential economic opportunities associated with this.
