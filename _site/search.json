    "text": "Research themes:\nThree research themes have been identified:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity values in decision making\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values associated with the economics of biodiversity are more nuanced than market valuation, and the values that different individuals, groups, organisations and sectors assign to biodiversity are not uniform.\nThis theme seeks to better understand how biodiversity values are captured in decision making and where new and existing data and evidence informs the types of interventions required to maintain, enhance and optimise biodiversity in terms of its value to functional landscapes and the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity, natural capital and resilience\n\n\n\n\n\nResilience has multiple definitions across disciplines. In this context, it refers to the ability of subjects (populations, organisms, systems or networks) to withstand, recover from, or adapt to disturbance. Both ecological and socioeconomic systems within which human societies operate can be considered in relation to their resilience to disturbances.\nThis theme considers the economics of biodiversity through the lens of the interconnected socioeconomic and ecological systems. The aim is to generate new thinking and knowledge regarding what represents resilient, sustainable, healthy and fair systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement tools for decision makers\n\n\n\n\n\nThis theme considers how the economics of biodiversity can be applied to support management decisions. This theme explores if and where this data gap exists.\nIt investigates how to make data of sufficient quality available for accurate and integrated forecasting and reporting on biodiversity, natural capital, fiscal forecasting and predictive modelling used in decision making. This includes economic, financial, population, cultural value and environmental data.\nUnder this theme, the emphasis is on improving scalability, interoperability and user uptake of decision support tools. This includes working with:\n\ntemporal variability, for example seasonality and land use change\nspatial variability, for example topography land parcel location bordering land use\ndiffering knowledge requirements for various users, for example local, regional and national priorities."

Currently, Ecosystem Services assessments often disregard differences in habitat extent, condition and quality, and the effect these factors have on the services performed. Furthermore, complex pluralistic values (reflective of multiple perspectives/priorities) are rarely well understood, and often disregarded in decision-making processes. Our project seeks both to plug this critical evidence gap, supporting the integration of biodiversity values into decision-making at all levels. Combining this information, we will apply these new values to co-develop scalable green finance options, leading to a transformative shift in our understanding and utilisation of the economics of biodiversity.\nFor more information, see our project website.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Economics\n\n\nEcosystem Services\n\n\nNatural Capital\n\n\nPluralistic Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Biodiversity Credits project is led by Professor Nicola Beaumont at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory."

Among the many stalls, activities, and crowds, we set up our ‘Sound Lab’, where we exposed festivalgoers to sounds of nature and asked how it made them feel.\n\n\n\nIncreasingly, children are growing up with less opportunity for interactions with the natural world. We wanted to cultivate curiosity and encourage a deeper connection with nature – and sound is a great way to do this. We aimed to introduce the over 350 children (and their parents) who visited our Sound Lab to concepts of acoustic ecology and encourage them to think about the soundscapes we experience every day, and how this can affect how we feel.\nWe attempted to give the children an immersive acoustic experience, showing sounds in real time using a live spectrogram generator – a tool that visually represents sounds in real-time. Given the festival context of our activity, we gave children a chance to make their own soundscapes using musical instruments, before moving on to soft toys of UK bird species with inbuilt birdsong recordings. This created much excitement among the children as identifiable visual spectrogram patterns of different species’ songs appeared in front of their eyes. We finished the activity by giving the children the opportunity to create a complex species-rich dawn chorus soundscape.\n\n\n\n Simon Butler and Claire Buchan standing awkwardly in the science tent.

While the children inside were making ‘music’, we couldn’t help but do a bit of science.\nWe asked adults to listen to three different soundscapes which varied in the number of species singing and presence of traffic noise. After listening to each soundscape, they were asked to anonymously report how each made them feel. Once we got home (and had a shower), we tallied up the data and were excited to find evidence that species rich soundscapes make people happier than species poor soundscapes, but this benefit is lower if there is road traffic noise in the background:\n\n\n Proportion of respondents scoring each soundscape by how it made them feel.
